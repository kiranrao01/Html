              Databases are a collection of information,
               they are used for creating, manipulating,
               and deleting data. There are many different
                tyes of databases and they can be classified
                in a basic approach of relational database or
                a non-relational database. Relationships
                means a set of our data is related to another
                 section of our data. Our databases are put into
                  sections of data called schemes, inside each schema
                   each data set is organized intro tables, those
                   tables contain columns and rows to house that
                   particular set of data.

              All databases are just a bin of storage.
               This storage is housed on your harddrive,
                often larger companies will have floors
                 upon floors of just database storage
                 (think NSA styled). Our computer stores
                  to create new information, read information,
                   update information and delete information.

                Since there could potentially be a lot of
                 information a database stores one problem
                  we might run into is finding the data we
                  are looking for. Imagine we had a room
                  full of books and you were asked to find
                  the Coding Dojo Algorithim Book. Well you
                  might start picking up each book, checking
                  the title and moving onto the next until you
                  found it. That's very slow as most libraries
                  discoveed. Instead if we were to ID each item
                   we can find it quickly.

              The amazing part about having a Database
              is that it is a storage bin that holds onto
               all saved data. Well if only one user had
               access to that data its just like what we
               have built into our own computers, it wouldnt
                be useful to other users. However the joy
                of having a database is that it is a stronge
                 bin many users can interact with, creating,
                 reading, updating and deleting information
                  that all users would see.

            <p>
              There are a lot of large companies that specialize
              in the storing of information. As Big Data has
              erupted so too have the size and amount of companues
               on the market That being said, a ot of their
                software is free for most users, think of MySQL,
                 which while being an incredible DB is completely
                  free of cost and is used by a large company
                  called Facebook.
