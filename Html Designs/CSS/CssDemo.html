      There are three ways of attaching CSS to a document:
       inline, internal, and external. Inline and internal
       CSS are considered to be bad practices. We will only
       use external stylesheets, linked from the HTML document
       using the (head) tag. Refer back to the HTML section if
       you don't remember how to do this.

    <p class="Second">
      A declaration block is a list of declarations contained
      within braces. Each individual declaration consists of a
      property, a colon (":"), and a value. If a block has multiple
      declarations, they must be separated by a semi-colon(";").
